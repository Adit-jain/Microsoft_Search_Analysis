The rewards are puny, takes about a month to accumulate enough points to redeem for a $5 Amazon gift card. But after you have earned bing rewards consistently, they will arbitrarily label your account as suspicious activity, which render it very difficult to earn more search points. Even worse, after they suffer you to redeem a couple times, they will no longer suffer you to redeem your points, giving you a message saying \"This order cannot be completed at this time. Please try again later. If you\\'re unable to complete this order after 24 hours, contact customer support.\" If you contact customer support, they will not even bother to reply. You are thereby left with no recourse whatsoever, all your efforts spent on accumulating your points gone to waste. At this point, they reckon that you have used bing long enough to form a habit, they no longer need to reward you anymore, and withal save their lousy rewards to hook in new suckers.',\n",

Their offer states:\"Get started with £400 in free advertising credit when you spend just £200*.\"I chose Microsoft Advertising as the platform for my business, believing they’d be a reliable, trustworthy brand to support me. However, this experience has left me feeling misled.After spending £150(approximately), I contacted Bing support to ask when the credit would activate, only to find out the offer hadn’t been applied to my account at all. Support informed me that they would now apply the credit and it would activate when I had spent £200. It now turns out that I have to spend £200 from that point forward to unlock it. Meaning I would have to spend £350(approximately) in total before the credit was applied. Escalating this issue got the matter no further. This was disappointing, as the promotion details do not specify any additional steps to activate the credit, nor do they mention needing to apply a coupon at the opening of the account.Their terms state:\"*Offer details: Offer expires June 30, 2025. Valid only for new Microsoft Advertising customers in the United Kingdom who are first party recipients of the offer. A new Microsoft Advertising customer is one that has not had an active Microsoft Advertising account before. Limit one promotional offer per new Microsoft Advertising customer.\"\"Once customer completes Microsoft Advertising new customer account setup and spends at least £200 on advertising charges, the promotional credit of £400 will automatically be applied.\"I had followed the stated requirements, but Microsoft Advertising’s system did not apply the credit as expected. If you plan to use this offer, I strongly suggest contacting Bing Advertising directly to ensure the promotion is correctly applied to your account before you start spending.Unfortunately, this experience has left me feeling very foolish for having such trust in Bing.I have since chosen to close my account.',\n",
